The Mobility Database Catalogs is a list of open mobility data feeds from across the world. [You can learn more about the Mobility Database and its API here](https://mobilitydatabase.org/). 

[You can see our API code and infrastructure here](https://github.com/MobilityData/mobility-feed-api).

To search feeds easily, you can download [the CSV spreadsheet](https://share.mobilitydata.org/catalogs-csv). If you want to filter for specific types of feeds, [you can learn how to here](#get-and-filter-feeds).

## Browsing and Consuming The Spreadsheet

If you're only interested in browsing the feeds or pulling all the latest URLs, [download the CSV](https://share.mobilitydata.org/catalogs-csv). You can cross reference IDs from the Mobility Database, TransitFeeds and Transitland with [this ID map spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Q96KDppKsn2khdrkraZCQ7T_qRSfwj7WsvqXvuMt4Bc/edit?resourcekey#gid=1787149399).

If you are consuming the spreadsheet, we recommend downloading a new version every time you use it, since the `latest.url` is occasionally updated to match any changes made to the provider and subdivision name within the feed file.

## How Often is the Database Updated?

Updating the CSV is a community effort. Contributors either create a PR here directly or they submit an update through [the form](https://mobilitydatabase.org/contribute), which MobilityData then adds as a PR within approximately a week of submission. You can look at [the PR history](https://github.com/MobilityData/mobility-database-catalogs/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed) to see how frequently there are updates, and we usually do updates 1-3 times a month.

## The Architecture

### Catalogs

Contains the feeds of the Mobility Database Catalogs. Every single feed is represented by a JSON file. The feeds can be aggregated by criteria using our `tools.operations` functions.

### Tools

Contains the tools to search, add and update the feeds. The `tools.operations` module contains the project operations (get, add and update). The `tools.helpers` module contains helper functions that support the `tools.operations` module. The `tools.constants` module contains the project constants.

### Schemas

Contains the JSON schemas used to validate the feeds in the integration tests.

## Installation

### Requirements

#### MacOs

To use and run this project properly, you must install all its requirements. Make sure Python 3.9+ and Pip are installed:

```sh
$ python3 --version
$ pip --version
```

If not, install them with:

```sh
$ brew install python3.9
$ curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
$ sudo python get-pip.py
```

Make sure both GDAL and RTree (Libspatialindex) libraries are installed on your computer, which are required for one of the project dependencies, the [GTFS Kit Library](https://pypi.org/project/gtfs-kit/):

```sh
$ brew install GDAL
$ brew install spatialindex
```

It is recommended to set up a virtual environment before installing the requirements. To set up and activate a Python 3.9 virtual environment, enter the following commands:

```sh
$ python3.9 -m venv env
$ source env/bin/activate
```

Once your virtual environment is activated, enter the following command to install the project requirements:

```sh
(env) $ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To deactivate your virtual environment, enter the following command:

```sh
(env) $ deactivate
```

If you are working with IntelliJ or PyCharm, it is possible to use this virtual environment within the IDE. To do so, follow the instructions to create a virtual environment [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/creating-virtual-environment.html).

### Repository

To use it, clone the project on your local machine using HTTP with the following commands:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/MobilityData/mobility-database-catalogs.git
$ cd mobility-database-catalogs
```

## Get and Filter Feeds

### Setup

Follow the steps described in the [Installation](#installation) section.

### Run it

To use the Mobility Database Catalogs, go to the cloned project root, open the Python interpreter and import the project operations:

```sh
$ cd mobility-catalogs
$ python
>>> from tools.operations import *
```

To get the feeds:

```python
>>> get_sources()
```

To get the feeds by subdivision name, where `$SUBDIVISION_NAME` is a ISO 3166-2 subdivision name:

```python
>>> get_sources_by_subdivision_name(subdivision_name=$SUBDIVISION_NAME)
```

To get the feeds by country code, where `$COUNTRY_CODE` is a ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code:

```python
>>> get_sources_by_country_code(country_code=$COUNTRY_CODE)

```

To get the feeds by bounding box, where `$MINIMUM_LATITUDE` `$MAXIMUM_LATITUDE` `$MINIMUM_LONGITUDE` and `$MAXIMUM_LONGITUDE` are expressed as floats:

```python
>>> get_sources_by_bounding_box(
        minimum_latitude=$MINIMUM_LATITUDE,
        maximum_latitude=$MAXIMUM_LATITUDE,
        minimum_longitude=$MINIMUM_LONGITUDE,
        maximum_longitude=$MAXIMUM_LONGITUDE
    )
```

To get the feeds by feature, `$FEATURE` is expressed as a string and must be one of:

* `fares-v2`  
* `fares-v1`  
* `flex-v1`  
* `flex-v2`  
* `pathways`  
* `occupancy`  

```python
>>> get_sources_by_feature(
        feature=$FEATURE,
    )
```

To get the feeds by status, `$STATUS` is expressed as a string and one of:

* `active`  
* `deprecated`  
* `inactive`  
* `development`  

```python
>>> get_sources_by_status(
        status=$STATUS,
    )
```
## Integration Tests

In order to avoid invalid feeds in the Mobility Database Catalogs, any modification made in the repository, addition or update, must pass the integration tests before being merged into the project. The integration tests are listed in the [Test Integration](/tests/test_integration.py) module.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to the project! You can add and update feeds or contribute code. Please check out our [Contribution guidelines](/CONTRIBUTING.md) for details. Any PRs or [form contributions](https://mobilitydatabase.org/contribute) will be responded to within a week of submission.
